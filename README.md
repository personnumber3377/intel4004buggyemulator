# intel4004buggyemulator
This is a VERY buggy intel 4004 cpu emulator.

 It treats all registers peripherals memory etc as variables and i only put 256 bytes of available ram, because i do not even fully understand the memory architecture etc.. THIS IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT (AND WILL BE FOR QUITE A LONG TIME, BECAUSE I AM LAZY) AND ALSO I AM VERY ANTISOCIAL SO DO NOT TAKE IT PERSONALLY IF I DO NOT ALLOW YOU TO MAKE COMMITS. (my first github repo. yeay!) Feel free to test it and report bugs. (WARNING: The code is not readable at all.)
